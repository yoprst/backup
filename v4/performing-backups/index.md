Performing Backups
==================

The most basic command for performing a backup is:

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup

This command will load the main configuration file, located by default at `~/SlidayBackup/config.rb`, along with all the
models found in the `models/` sub-directory at this location. Therefore, in order for the above command to work, a model
must exist which defines the `my_backup` trigger.

``` rb
Model.new(:my_backup, 'My Backup') do
  # sliday_backup configuration...
end
```

The best way to create your initial main configuration file and backup model file(s) is to use the [Generator][generator].


Command Line Options
--------------------

**--trigger** (aliases: --triggers, -t)

The `--trigger` option specifies which backup model you wish to run.

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup
    $ sliday_backup perform -t my_backup

To asynchronously perform multiple models, specify multiple triggers in the order you wish the jobs to run.

    $ sliday_backup perform --triggers my_backup_1,my_backup_2,my_backup_3 (no spaces)


**--config-file** (alias: -c)

Use this option to specify the location of your configuration file.

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --config-file /path/to/config.rb

If not specified, the default location of `~/Backup/config.rb` will be used.


**--data-path** (alias: -d)

Backup has a [Cycling][storages] feature, which can automatically perform backup rotation for you.
In order to do this, Backup stores YAML formatted data files with information about your backups.
By default, these files are stored in `~/SlidayBackup/.data`. If you are storing this data in another location,
it will need to be specified using the `--data-path` option.

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --data-path /path/to/data/dir/


**--tmp-path**

During the backup process, all of the Archives and Databases being processed are stored in `~/Backup/.tmp` before being
transferred to your Storages. If you want to use a different directory for this, use:

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --tmp-path /path/to/.tmp/


**--log-path** (alias: -l)

Used to specify the location of Backup's log file. See the [Logging][logging] page for more info.

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --log-path /path/to/logs/


**--root-path** (alias: -r)

If you are happy with the default directory names, but would like to establish this hierarchy in a location other
than `~/SlidayBackup`, then you can specify a new root directory using:

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --root-path /path/to/root/dir/

The `--root-path` may be specified as an absolute path, or a relative path from where the `backup` command is being run.
In either case, the specified directory must exist.

The command above would then result in:

    --config-file => /path/to/root/dir/config.rb
    --data-path   => /path/to/root/dir/.data/
    --log-path    => /path/to/root/dir/log/
    --tmp-path    => /path/to/root/dir/.tmp/

If you use the `--root-path` option, you can still specify one of the other options above. However, how that option will
behave depends on how you specify the path for that option. If the other option is specified as an absolute path,
then it will be used as you supply it. If it is given as a relative path, it will be appended to the specified
`--root-path`. Note that while `--root-path` must already exist, all other paths specified will be created if needed.

**Examples:**

```
$ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --root-path /new/root/ --tmp-path /tmp/backup

--config-file => /new/root/config.rb
--data-path   => /new/root/.data/
--log-path    => /new/root/log/
--tmp-path    => /tmp/backup/
```
```
$ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --root-path /new/root/ --tmp-path temp/dir/ --config-file my_config.rb

--config-file => /new/root/my_config.rb
--data-path   => /new/root/.data/
--log-path    => /new/root/log/
--tmp-path    => /new/root/temp/dir/
```

Given you are running `backup` from the directory `/foo`:

```
$ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --root-path my_backups --tmp-path temp/dir/

--config-file => /foo/my_backups/config.rb
--data-path   => /foo/my_backups/.data/
--log-path    => /foo/my_backups/log/
--tmp-path    => /foo/my_backups/temp/dir/
```
```
$ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --root-path . --tmp-path /tmp/backup --config-file cfg_dir/cfg.rb

--config-file => /foo/cfg_dir/cfg.rb
--data-path   => /foo/.data/
--log-path    => /foo/log/
--tmp-path    => /tmp/backup/
```


Checking for Configuration Errors
---------------------------------

The `check` command is used to check your Backup configuration. This command will load your
`config.rb` file, along with all of your _model_ files, and report any Errors or Warnings
generated. This allows to you check your configuration files for syntax errors, as well as
detecting other errors or warning such as the use of deprecated configuration settings.
It is recommended that you run `sliday_backup check` whenever you update `backup`.

If your `config.rb` file is not in the default location of `~/SlidayBackup/config.rb`, use the
`--config-file` argument to specify it's location.

    $ sliday_backup check --config-file /path/to/config.rb

As a convenience, this check may also be performed by adding the `--check` option to your
`sliday_backup perform` command, in which case the `trigger` specified will not be performed.

    $ sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup --check

The result of this check will be output to the console only. Any [Logger][logging] configuration
will be ignored. If the check is successful, this command will exit with status code `0`. If there
are any errors/warnings, it will exit with status code `1`.

Note that there are certain actions performed during the backup process that may generate errors and/or
warnings this check can not detect. While this will catch most problems, you should of course
use `perform` to confirm your backup jobs will succeed.


Exit Status Codes
-----------------

The `sliday_backup perform` command will exit with the following status codes:

**0**: All triggers were successful and no warnings were issued.  
**1**: All triggers were successful, but some had warnings.  
**2**: All triggers were _processed_, but some failed.  
**3**: A fatal error caused SlidayBackup to exit. Some triggers may not have been processed.


Passing Arbitrary Variables
---------------------------

If you wish to pass in parameters other then the predefined Command Line Options,
you can do so using environment-variables. For example:

    $ DB_NAME=my_app_production STORAGE_PATH=~/backups/production \
      sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup

Then, you can access these in the `my_backup.rb` model:

```rb
Model.new(:my_backup, 'Description for my_backup') do
  database MongoDB do |db|
    db.name = ENV["DB_NAME"] || "default_name"
    #...
  end

  store_with Local do |local|
    local.path = ENV['STORAGE_PATH']
  end
end
```

Or you can use a single environment-variable to setup a number of local variables:

    $ BACKUP_ENV=production sliday_backup perform --trigger my_backup

Then, configure your model using:

```rb
Model.new(:my_backup, 'Description for my_backup') do
  case ENV['BACKUP_ENV']
  when 'production'
    db_name = 'my_app_production'
    storage_path = '~/backups/production'
  when 'development'
    db_name = 'my_app_development'
    storage_path = '~/backups/development'
  else
    raise 'you must provide BACKUP_ENV'
  end

  database MongoDB do |db|
    db.name = db_name
    #...
  end

  store_with Local do |local|
    local.path = storage_path
  end
end
```
