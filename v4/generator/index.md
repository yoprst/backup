Generator
=========

The Backup generator is a very useful little tool to help you set up backups faster.

To bring up the `help` screen, run the following command:

    $ backup help generate:model

It'll display something like this:

    Usage:
      backup generate:model -t, --trigger=TRIGGER

    Options:
      -t, --trigger=TRIGGER            # Trigger name for the Backup model
          [--config-file=CONFIG_FILE]  # Path to your Backup configuration file
          [--databases=DATABASES]      # (mongodb, mysql, postgresql, redis, riak)
          [--storages=STORAGES]        # (cloud_files, dropbox, ftp, local, ninefold, rsync, s3, scp, sftp)
          [--syncers=SYNCERS]          # (cloud_files, rsync_local, rsync_pull, rsync_push, s3)
          [--encryptor=ENCRYPTOR]      # (gpg, openssl)
          [--compressor=COMPRESSOR]    # (bzip2, custom, gzip)
          [--notifiers=NOTIFIERS]      # (campfire, hipchat, http_post, mail, nagios, prowl, pushover, twitter)
          [--archives]                 # Model will include tar archives.


The options is what makes setting up a Backup configuration file a breeze.

Example
-------

Say you have two databases, a [MongoDB][database-mongodb] and a [PostgreSQL][database-postgresql] database. You want to
backup these two databases and compress them with Gzip. You then want to package them up, encrypt them with
[GPG][encryptor-gpg], and store the backup to [Amazon S3][storage-s3]. Additionally, you have around 50GB of
"user-uploaded-content" in `/var/apps/my_app/public/uploads` you would like to [keep a mirror][syncer-s3] of on Amazon
S3. And finally, you want to be notified by email if there are any problems.

To get up and running quickly, issue the following command:

    $ backup generate:model --trigger my_backup \
        --databases="mongodb, postgresql" --storages="s3" \
        --encryptor="gpg" --compressor="gzip" --notifiers="mail"

This will create a new file: `~/Backup/models/my_backup.rb` (the default location), and the file will look like this:

```rb
##
# Backup Generated: my_backup
# Once configured, you can run the backup with the following command:
#
# $ backup perform -t my_backup [-c <path_to_configuration_file>]
#
# For more information about Backup's components, see the documentation at:
# http://meskyanichi.github.io/backup

Model.new(:my_backup, 'Description for my_backup') do

Just omit what you don't need, and change what you do need and you're done.

**Note:** If you want to change the path where the model file will be generated, use the `--config-file` option
to specify the path to your configuration file. Models will be placed into a `models/` directory where your
configuration file is located.

    $ backup generate:model --config-file='/path/to/my_config.rb' --trigger my_backup (etc...)

This would create: `/path/to/models/my_backup.rb`.


Main Configuration File
-----------------------

Generating the model above will also create the main Backup configuration file if it does not already exist.
By default, this would be `~/Backup/config.rb`. You may supply the `--config-file` option to specify a different path.
This is the first file Backup will load when performing your backup job. This is where you will setup any global
configuration and component defaults.

```rb
##
# Backup v4.x Configuration
#
# Documentation: http://meskyanichi.github.io/backup
# Issue Tracker: https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/issues

##
# Config Options
#
# The options here may be overridden on the command line, but the result
# will depend on the use of --root-path on the command line.
#
# If --root-path is used on the command line, then all paths set here
# will be overridden. If a path (like --tmp-path) is not given along with
# --root-path, that path will use it's default location _relative to --root-path_.
#
# If --root-path is not used on the command line, a path option (like --tmp-path)
# given on the command line will override the tmp_path set here, but all other
# paths set here will be used.
#
# Note that relative paths given on the command line without --root-path
# are relative to the current directory. The root_path set here only applies
# to relative paths set here.
#
# ---
#
# Sets the root path for all relative paths, including default paths.
# May be an absolute path, or relative to the current working directory.
#
# root_path 'my/root'
#
# Sets the path where backups are processed until they're stored.
# This must have enough free space to hold apx. 2 backups.
# May be an absolute path, or relative to the current directory or +root_path+.
#
# tmp_path  'my/tmp'
#
# Sets the path where backup stores persistent information.
# When Backup's Cycler is used, small YAML files are stored here.
# May be an absolute path, or relative to the current directory or +root_path+.
#
# data_path 'my/data'

##
# Utilities
#
# If you need to use a utility other than the one Backup detects,
# or a utility can not be found in your $PATH.
#
#   Utilities.configure do
#     tar       '/usr/bin/gnutar'
#     redis_cli '/opt/redis/redis-cli'
#   end

##
# Logging
#
# Logging options may be set on the command line, but certain settings
# may only be configured here.
#
#   Logger.configure do
#     console.quiet     = true            # Same as command line: --quiet
#     logfile.max_bytes = 2_000_000       # Default: 500_000
#     syslog.enabled    = true            # Same as command line: --syslog
#     syslog.ident      = 'my_app_backup' # Default: 'backup'
#   end
#
# Command line options will override those set here.
# For example, the following would override the example settings above
# to disable syslog and enable console output.
#   backup perform --trigger my_backup --no-syslog --no-quiet

##
# Component Defaults
#
# Set default options to be applied to components in all models.
# Options set within a model will override those set here.
#
#   Storage::S3.defaults do |s3|
#     s3.access_key_id     = "my_access_key_id"
#     s3.secret_access_key = "my_secret_access_key"
#   end
#
#   Notifier::Mail.defaults do |mail|
#     mail.from                 = 'sender@email.com'
#     mail.to                   = 'receiver@email.com'
#     mail.address              = 'smtp.gmail.com'
#     mail.port                 = 587
#     mail.domain               = 'your.host.name'
#     mail.user_name            = 'sender@email.com'
#     mail.password             = 'my_password'
#     mail.authentication       = 'plain'
#     mail.encryption           = :starttls
#   end

##
# Preconfigured Models
#
# Create custom models with preconfigured components.
# Components added within the model definition will
# +add to+ the preconfigured components.
#
#   preconfigure 'MyModel' do
#     archive :user_pictures do |archive|
#       archive.add '~/pictures'
#     end
#
#     notify_by Mail do |mail|
#       mail.to = 'admin@email.com'
#     end
#   end
#
#   MyModel.new(:john_smith, 'John Smith Backup') do
#     archive :user_music do |archive|
#       archive.add '~/music'
#     end
#
#     notify_by Mail do |mail|
#       mail.to = 'john.smith@email.com'
#     end
#   end
```

For more information on the `Utilities` configuration, see the [Utilities][utilities] page.  
For more information on the `Logger` configuration, see the [Logging][logging] page.

By default, Backup will look for this file in `~/Backup/config.rb`. If you want to place your configuration files in a
different location, use the `--config-file` option:

    $ backup perform --trigger my_backup --config-file '/path/to/config.rb'

If you relocate this file, be sure to move the `models` directory as well.

If you need to re-generate only a configuration file, you can do so using:

    $ backup generate:config --config-file /path/to/my_config.rb
